<h3> Introduction</h3>
These are simplified versions of the tutorials from the Ethereum website.<br>
We will be writing the contracts in solidity , other languages are available,<br>
but solidity is at the moment the most popular</p>

<p>We will be using the online solidity compiler, I will look at other IDEs such as Truffle later <br>
    I have picked this as it is quite simple when you are starting out<br>
<p>The online compiler has a runtime that allows some limited testing against an in memory blockchain in the browser, we shall see how to deploy to a real block chain later.</p>

<a href="http://ethereum.github.io/browser-solidity/">Solidity Compiler and Runtime</a><br>
<p>Open this in a browser, it starts with a default contract called Ballot, close the tab containing this.<br>
<p>Click the green new page icon to create a new contract and paste the greeter code given above into the tab.<br>
<p>Click on the tab label that says untitled, to rename the tab to Greeter.sol</p>
You should then have something like this<br>

<img  height = "600" src="../img/compile1.png" >

<p>At the right of the screen we can see the result of the compiled contract</p>

<img height = "600" src="../img/compile2.png" >

<p>Typically you won't need to use the bytecode, but you will need to use the Interface and Web3 deploy information if you are deploying to a real block chain </p>

<h4> The Solidity Language </h4>

<p>If you know Javascript  / Java / C then Solidity should look familiar, the langauge itself is not difficult, the work lies in how to create an app that is suitable for the block chain.<br>
    You will see that we have a variable called greeting of type string, and 2 functions.<br>
    The function greeter, having the same name as the function will run when the contract is created, similar to constructors in object oriented languages<br>
    The function greet provides the functionality of the contract.
  </p>

<h4>Functions</h4>

Interaction with the contract is via functions, in this case we have one function
<pre><code>
  function greet() constant returns (string) {
  return greeting;
  }
</code></pre>
when this is called it returns the string value that we provided in the constructor function.<br>
Note that this function is marked as constant, this means that it does not alter the state of the blockchain, it is in effect read only.<br>
As such we do not need to create a full transaction to call it, we can simply run the function on our local node.<br>
As this function stands anyone can call it, if we wish to restrict who can call functions, we use modifiers, we will see these later.<br>

<p><br>
  We are still working within the browser with an in memory blockchain, so lets deploy our simple contract to that<br>

our constructor takes one argument the greeter string, so we need to supply that in the box, and click the create button<br>

after a short time (during which you may see a "waiting to be mined message") you will see the deployed contract</p>

The points to note are :
<ul>

<li>Greeter at 0x692a70d2e424a56d2c6c27aa97d1a86395877b3a (memory)<br>
This is the address of the deployed contract, when you want to interact with the contract you need to know this</li>
<li>below that the red and blue buttons represent the functions that can be called, clicking the button will call that function on the deployed contract <br>
the colour of the button indicates whether it is a constant function or not, blue means it is a constant function.</li>
<li>The fallback function - by default all contracts have a fallback function, if you send ether to a contract, or try to call a non existent function on a contract, the fallback function will be called.<br>
This was at the heart of the DAO attack, so be careful with this function. </li>
<li>bytecode  - these are the actual instructions that are put on the blockchain, not the source code, so for example comments in the source code don't get added to the blockchain</li>
<li>Web3 deploy - this is a piece of javascript that we can use to deploy the contract to a real blockchain, we will see how later </li>
</ul>
