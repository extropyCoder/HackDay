<h2>
    Connecting to the live or test networks
</h2>

In order to connect to the private network, we had to use a special configuration.

<h3>Live</h3>
Connection to the live network is much simpler.
You can just start up mist, and it will start it's own node and synchronise with the live network.

If you want to use the command line tools you can just run :

<h4>(Macosx or Linux)</h4>
<code>
geth
</code>

<h4>Windows</h4>
open geth.exe



<h3>Test</h3>
