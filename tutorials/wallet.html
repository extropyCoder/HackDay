Install Software
You need to install 2 pieces of software
Geth  - this runs your node on the network
Mist - this acts as a wallet and dapp browser



<h3>Macosx</h3>

<h4>Geth</h4>
You first need to install <a href="http://brew.sh"> Homebrew </a>
Make sure it is up to date
<code>
    brew update
    brew upgrade
</code>
then install ethereum
<code>
brew tap ethereum/ethereum
brew install ethereum
</code>

If you have problems the full documentation is <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Installation-Instructions-for-Mac">here</a>

You can start it to check the install, but we need to start it with a special configuration to connect to a private network.

<h4>Mist</h4>

<h3>Other Versions</h3>
All versions of the wallet and Mist can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases"> here </a>



<h2>Connecting to a private network</h2>
Synchronising with the live blockchain can take a long time, and to develop on that blockchain costs real Ether, therefore we will be using a private network.

<h3>Setup a workspace</h3>

<h4>Macosx</h4>
Download (or copy from USB) <a href="zip"> workspace </a> into a suitable directory.

You should have the following structure

\workspace
    start_geth.sh
    \data
      chaindata
      static-nodes

to start your node run the start_geth.sh script (you may need to change its permissions for it to run)
